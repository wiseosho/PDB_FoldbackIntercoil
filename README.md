# PDB_FoldbackIntercoil

To construct the coordinate information of Foldback Intercoil motif, the suggested sequence of 39 base-pair of B-form DNA was generated [42]. Those B-form DNA is composed of three regions; loop, stem, and tail. After the standard B-form DNA was constructed, it was unwounded that the helicity was removed (a). Second, base-pairs in the loop region were bended to the point that the distance between interfacing base-pairs next to the loop region is distanced about ~2.2 â„« (b). Once reached, two base-pairs of each termini of the loop section were symmetrically rotated into the opposite direction until facing base-pair in the stem section is parallelized (c). This parallelization slightly increase the distance between interfacing base-pairs in the stem region, so overall process of loop bending and stem parallelization was repeated until the distance between the interfacing base-pairs of the stem region is reasonably close enough, which means atoms in each base-pairs are not overlapping (d). Stem section of the base-pairs was rotated about z-axis again to form intercooled helical structure of the Foldback intercoil DNA motif (e). Rest of the bases were bended and rotated accordingly to form tail region of typical flexible B-form duplex DNA (f).
